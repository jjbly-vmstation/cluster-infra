# The actual change added tasks to patch the Keycloak StatefulSet env (DB vars),
# create/update a ConfigMap `keycloak-startup` using a heredoc written to a temp file,
# apply the ConfigMap, and restart the Keycloak pod to persist the startup script change.

# Placeholder for the patched tasks; capture real content from /opt/vmstation-org on the deployment host.
